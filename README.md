# Motivation
Imagine recovering from a stroke to find yourself unable to decipher even the simplest of words on paper, even though you can still understand when spoken to. Or that you move to a foreign country for work-related reasons and find yourself bewildered by the signs and menus.   

I wanted to develop an app that could be used by members of the low-vision community, children/adults with reading differences, or those traveling/living abroad. With this app, a user can take a picture of a sign, document, or any other text and the app will convert the textual content into clear and comprehensible speech.
